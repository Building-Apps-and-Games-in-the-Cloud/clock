I'm sorry about this, but this example repository got left behind from an original draft of the book text. You can use the examples here for part of chapter 2 but you can find all the real examples here: [https://github.com/Building-Apps-and-Games-in-the-Cloud/Building-Apps-and-Games-in-the-Cloud.github.io](https://github.com/Building-Apps-and-Games-in-the-Cloud/Building-Apps-and-Games-in-the-Cloud.github.io)

Many apologies. If you send an email to WrongRepository@robmiles.com I will send you a "Certificate of Having Found an Error in Rob's Book".

best wishes

Rob Miles
